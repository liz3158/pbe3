                    A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, 
                    egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, 
                    nuts, etc.<br><br>
 
                     In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, 
                     crunchy cookies are called biscuits. Many Canadians also use this term.
                     Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom.[3] 
                     Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.

                      A cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Hiberno-English: bun; Australian English: fairy cake or patty cake) 
                    is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger 
                    cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied<br><br><br><br><br>

                      Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest forms,
                      cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and 
                      that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.<br><br><br><br><br>

                    <font color="lightgrey">
                      The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici during the 
                    Renaissance. Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling 
                    sandwiched between two such cookies, akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled 
                    circumference—referred to as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")—and a flat base. <br><br>
